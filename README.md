# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
My personal project goals are to be able to better understand interacting with datasets using sql and to be more comfortable with large databases.

## Process
### Review csv files to examine and identify patterns within excel 

### Import files from excel to pgadmin in order to clean and review data further with postgresql 

### Analyze data and run objective sql queries to answer insight forming questions within data 

### Identify patterns with data and identify areas of risk within data

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

- Major conceentration of business done is within United States
- Top sellers are apparel or Google Nest based
- Referral program has been successful in converting site visitors into paying customers

## Challenges 
One major challenge that was consistent throughout the entire project was that of technical difficulties. During the process of completing the project my computer and pgadmin consistently crashed to the point where I had to change computers and start all over from scratch. 

## Future Goals
If I had more time, I would definitely take a more in depth look at the relationships between the different datatypes and datasets.
